            <h2>Love Letter</h2>
            
            <p>Dear Sean,</p>
            <p style="line-height: 2;">       How cool is it that I can send you love letters using a website now! I want to take the opportunity to tell you how much you mean to me.
                We have both been working so hard lately it makes me so excited for our future. I know we always talked about how we have always wanted 
                a powerful partner so we could be a powerful couple and seeing it come to light makes me so happy. You truly inspire me every single day to 
                be better. You make me want to be extremely sucessful, to follow the career that im passionate about and to be the best partner I can possibly be 
                for you. I know I am not always perfect and slip up sometimes but hopefully you can feel how deeply I care about you. I have never been
                with someone who I respect and care for so much. You treat me better than anyone ever has and that makes me want to be my best self for you
                as well. We are different than any other couple I have ever met and I know we will push each other to be our best selves.
                Everytime we spend time together, the more I know you and the more I fall in love with who you are. I see all the best things in you and I feel
                so grateful everyday for getting to be in such a beautiful relationship with you. I know you are hard on yourself and see yourself as never being
                able to do enough but thats not what I see. I see the most beautiful qualities I've ever seen in a person, in you. And for that reason I know 
                that I will be able to be the partner you need to lift you up when youre down and remind you of the person you are when you dont see it.
                I've never felt more motivated and hopeful in my life and I attribute a lot of that to you. We have such a special relationship and it is 
                a dynamic I have never felt in a partner and now never want to go without. I know life gets stressful and there are a lot of unknowns that 
                come up but one thing you can absolutely count on is me being here by your side. Whether it's for advice, to vent, or to give you back scratches 
                when you need to destress, I am here for you just as I feel you are here for me. There will be a lot of ups and downs in life but having you makes
                me feel like nothing so bad could ever happen because I have you with me. You are my best friend and you make me smile more than and you
                else can. I am so incredibly grateful to have you in my life and I'm obsessed with you.
           </p>
           <p>Thank you for being you,</p>
           <p><strong>Bella</strong></p>
